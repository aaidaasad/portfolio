        '"Shadows of Justice" is an atmospheric, narrative-driven game where you play as a lost soul trapped in an abandoned, haunted police station. The environment is dark and eerie, with papers scattered across the decaying halls. Some papers glow as you approach, revealing crucial clues that guide you on your journey to escape. Follow the glowing trail, find hidden keys, and unlock doors to freedom. The shadows hold whispered secrets, but only the most observant players will survive.',
